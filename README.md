PATHFINDER PROJECT

Purpose: Implement a graph data structure for a practical application

Description :  I wanted to implement a weighed directed graph data structure. Because of its properties, weighed digraph is commonly used in mapping applications. I will use this graph in conjunction with the well-known Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find shortest path between two points on a map.The process will be likethis -> Input two files - one for CITY data and the other for ROAD data. Read the file and strore the, in appropriate data structure. and use it to find the shortest distance between two cities.

This is an implementation of Dijksta's algorithm. It contains the City and road creater file that can be used like an admin  to create the city and road file. TheDijkstra's_new file reads this file and dynamically makes a graph of the file and find's shortest distance between the two cities.

The "Create city and road" folder containts the code to make the city and road files and the "Finding shortest route folder contains the code to print graph and find the shortest route with full data as per the graph created of cities (Given in PDF)
